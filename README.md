# VERSION

0.44

# DESCRIPTION

Business::GoCardless is a set of libraries for easy interface to the gocardless
payment service, they implement most of the functionality currently found
in the service's API documentation: https://developer.gocardless.com

Current missing functionality is partner account handling, but all resource
manipulation (Bill, Merchant, Payout etc) is handled along with webhooks and
the checking/generation of signature, nonce, param normalisation, and other
such lower level interface with the API.
